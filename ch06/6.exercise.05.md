# Statement
# Write a grammar for bitwise logical expressions. A bitwise logical expression is much like an arithmetic expression except that the operators are ! (not), ~(complement), & (and), | (or), and ^(exclusive or). Each operator does its operation to each bit of its integer operands (see 25.5). ! and ~ are prefix unary operators. A ^ binds tighter than a | (just as * binds tighter than +) so that x|y^z means x|(y^z) rather than (x|y)^z. The & operator binds tighter than ^so that x^y&z means x^(y&Z).   


# Toughts
The grammar has to be very similar to the grammar weÂ´re managing for arithmethic expressions. There are two main differences:
* There are three levels of binding compared to two in the arithmetic grammar.
* Unary operators are introduced.

Expression:
    PTerm
    Expression "|" PTerm
PTerm:
    STerm
    PTerm "^" STerm
STerm:
    Unary
    STerm "&" Unary
Unary:
    Primary
    "!" Primary
    "~" Primary
Primary:
    Number
    "(" Expression ")"
Number:
    integer-number
