//Write a program that doesn't do anything, but declares a number of variables with legal and ilegal names (such as int double = 0;), so that you can see how the compiler reacts.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// int double;
// double delete;
 char _wtf;
 bool isfalse;
 
 std:: string I_want$s {"Hola"};
